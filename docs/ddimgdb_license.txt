The 'Dresden Image Database' website provides an interface to two different sources of images:

- the 'Dresden Image Database', which includes the original set of images as taken by the maintainer of the website and his colleagues, and
- an additional collection of flickr(r) images, taken by camera models that have also been used to compile the 'Dresden Image Database'.

The flickr images have been collected in an automated process using the official web api ( http://www.flickr.com/services/api/ ) and are provided as lists of links. These links have not been checked manually by the maintainer of this website and, the maintainer is not responsible for the content of the respective images. The images are hosted at flickr. Please respect the intellectual property and check http://www.flickr.com/ for further information.

If you download and use the images of the 'Dresden Image Database' you agree to the following license agreement. We are pleased to receive electronic copies of any publication making use of our database and to add your reference to the list of related publications.
